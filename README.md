## CrewAI Project: Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Simulation

### 1. Define the Tools:
- **Compiler Tool:** Compiles code and returns any compilation errors or warnings.
- **Sandbox Tool:** Executes code in a secure, isolated environment using technologies like Docker.

### 2. Create the Agents:
- **Requirements Agent:** Gathers and analyzes project requirements, creating a detailed specification.
- **Developer Agent:** Writes, debugs, and compiles code based on requirements, using the Compiler Tool and Sandbox Tool.
- **QA Tester Agent:** Tests the compiled code, performing unit, integration, and system tests.
- **Documentation Agent:** Generates project documentation, including user manuals and technical documentation.

### 3. Integrate Agents into a Crew:
- Assemble the agents into a Crew following a sequential process mimicking the SDLC.
- Requirements Agent -> Developer Agent -> QA Tester Agent -> Documentation Agent

### 4. Kick Off the Process:
- Initiate the Crew with an initial set of requirements.
- Crew progresses through the SDLC stages, with each agent completing its tasks before passing the work to the next agent.

#### Note: Implementation details such as security, scalability, and integration with other systems will be added.
